Welcome! This is my first project using Pygame.
Use the arrow keys to move across the map and eat the food items, which in this case are bananas. Each banana will increase or replenish your health by 5 points as well as increase the size of your character, which in this case is a chicken. You must do this while avoiding the wolf who is randomly moving in each screen. Contact with the wolf will result in damaging your health points. Each contact will continue to deduct points until you are able to move away from the wolf. Once your health reaches zero, the game will be over. At the very end of the map, you will reach the boss. Press spacebar to shoot fireballs at the boss and once his health reaches zero, you've won. Remember to turn on your sound; I've added some neat music and effects. I am currently working on a Play Again menu. In the future I hope to work on expanding the map and adding a character selection screen which will enable the user to choose which animal to play, and in effect, change the food items as well.
